# CTEC3905 Front-End Web Development
This repo contains lab excercises from my **CTEC3905 Front-End Web Development** module.

I am trying to practise each lab at least two times. One time with following the lab sheet, second time by doing everything based on what I have remembered.

I will publish each lab excercise to github pages.

# Lab excercises

## Lab 04:
[Lab version](https://hamxy.github.io/CTEC3905-Front-End/lab-04/index.html)

[Practice version](https://hamxy.github.io/CTEC3905-Front-End/lab-04/index-copy.html)
Additional features:
* `scroll-behaviour: smooth` - **Home** and **Blog** smoothly scrolls to sections
    * As navigation has fixed position `scroll-margin-top` was required to position scroll
* When navigation is open on mobile version clicking links or clicking main content will close navigation



# To-Do
- [] I'll consider creating a development branch for this repo to avoid unnecessary commits, ex. while editing README file
